## Description

This project utilizes the Random User API (https://randomuser.me/) to retrieve the information of random "employees", and use the data to create a prototype employee directory.

This prototype requests a JSON object and parses its data to efficiently display an "employee's" image, name, email, location, and dob from a mobile-first approach. The project features a simple search filter, view layout selection, pagination, and modals, as well as an employee quantity selection tool to generate any number of employees between 10 and 5000 for testing purposes.
